Create the object called “Customer Project” and create Status field under this object with picklist data type (Values=Active, Inactive). Create the relationship between this custom object and Opportunity so that Customer Project is related list to the Opportunity. Create Active Customer project field on Opportunity object (Data Type=Checkbox) The logic is when we create Customer Project for an Opportunity with the Status=Active, then Active Customer project check box on the Opportunity Detail page is automatically checked

trigger TriggerAssignment6 on Customer_Project__c (before insert) 
{
     Set <Customer_Project__c> cplist = new Set <Customer_Project__c>();
   	 Set<Id> oppidset = new Set<Id>();
   	 List <Opportunity> opplist = new List <Opportunity>();
   
   	 for(Customer_Project__c cp : Trigger.new)
     {    
           if(cp.Status__c == 'Active')
           {                      
               cplist.add(cp);   
               oppidset.add(cp.Opportunity__c);
           } 
    }
   
   if(oppidset <> null)
   {
        opplist = [select name,id,Active_Customer_project__c from Opportunity where ID in :oppidset];    
        for(Opportunity o :opplist)
        {
        o.Active_Customer_project__c=true;
      	} 
       update opplist;
    }

}
